We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests.
3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a regression test!
4. Make the test pass. 
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
6. Please write a general description of your changes along with the pull request.
