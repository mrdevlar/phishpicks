# User Story

So like many programming things, they start with a problem you want to solve that kind of spirals out of control.

In this case, the problem was, _"I want to be able to randomly play a Phish show"_. That was, in itself, a pretty easy thing to solve with a folder full of Phish shows. 

After a while new requirements came into play:

- I want to be able to pick a random show, but I don't want repeats
- I want to be able to transfer a show to my digital media player
- I want to be able to store a list of all the "good jams"
- I want to be able to keep a queue of next shows to listen to when they get recommended
- I want a programmatic interface to this system, so I can do arbitrary things with the data
- I want a command line interface for fast access
- I want to ...

It felt like one of the most organic development processes I've had the good fortune to create. Over time it did all of these things and became a "mature" system I turn to whenever I listen to Phish.

I hope that it might turn out to be useful to more than myself.
